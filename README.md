Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! 🎅🎁 Each day from December 1st to December 25th, I'll be tackling coding puzzles designed to challenge problem-solving skills and bring the joy of programming during the holiday season. 

## 🚀 About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of coding challenges created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each day unveils a new two-part puzzle that involves creative problem-solving, algorithm design, and optimization.

## 🧩 Repository Structure
This repository contains my solutions to the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges. Each day's challenge is implemented in Python, and the solutions are organized as follows:

```
📁 advent-of-code-2024/
├── 📂 day01/
│   ├── solution.py       # Solution to the Day 1 puzzle
│   ├── input.txt         # Input data for the puzzle
│   ├── README.md         # Description of the day's problem and approach
├── 📂 day02/
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── README.md
├── ...
└── README.md             # This file
```

- **`solution.py`**: Contains the code for solving the day's puzzle.
- **`input.txt`**: Contains the input data for the day's puzzle.
- **`README.md`** (optional): Details the problem and my thought process for solving it.

## 🛠️ How to Run
To test my solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bassem-Akrout/AOC.git
   cd AOC
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's folder:
   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```

3. Run the solution file:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

4. (Optional) Modify the `input.txt` file to test with custom input.

## 📝 Notes on My Solutions
- My primary language for the challenges is **Python**.
- I aim for readability and correctness over extreme optimization, though I enjoy experimenting with more efficient algorithms when time permits.
- Some puzzles might include alternative approaches or optimizations that I explored after submitting my solution.
